# SeniorProjectCarFuelConsuptionPredictionProject
2023 Senior Project Karabuk Univercity

The Car Fuel Consumption Prediction project is a senior project that focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate the fuel consumption of a car based on various input parameters. The project aims to provide users with a tool that can assist in understanding and optimizing fuel usage, which is not only beneficial for individual drivers but also contributes to environmental conservation by promoting efficient driving habits.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts car fuel consumption based on various factors such as engine displacement, horsepower, vehicle weight, and more. The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical car data with corresponding fuel efficiency measurements. Once trained, the model can be used to estimate the fuel consumption of a car given its specifications. This prediction can help users make informed decisions about their driving habits and vehicle choices.

Features
User-friendly command-line interface for inputting car specifications.
Utilizes a trained machine learning model to provide fuel consumption predictions.
Detailed visualization of prediction results.
Easy-to-understand codebase, making it suitable for educational purposes.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
Dataset
The project utilizes the "CarFuelData" dataset, which contains a comprehensive collection of car data along with corresponding fuel consumption measurements. The dataset is included in the project repository and can be found in the "data" directory.

Model
The predictive model is built using a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest) to map the relationships between car specifications and fuel consumption. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and validated for accuracy.

Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a held-out validation dataset. The model's ability to accurately predict fuel consumption is a key focus of the evaluation.
